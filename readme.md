  ```

  ‚Äì Appends the contents of `part1.txt` into `complete.txt` in the `~/notes/` directory.

---

### üìÅ File Copy, Move, and Rename ‚Äì With Paths (Including `~` Home Shortcut)

* **Using `~` to represent the user's home directory:**

  ```bash
  cp ~/Downloads/file.txt ~/Documents/
  ```

  This copies `file.txt` from the `Downloads` folder to the `Documents` folder inside your home directory.

* **Rename a file inside the home directory:**

  ```bash
  mv ~/notes/todo.txt ~/notes/done.txt
  ```

  This renames `todo.txt` to `done.txt` in the `notes` directory under home.

  ```bash
  mv *.txt ~/TextFiles/
  ```
* **move a full folder into home:**

  ```bash
  mv Day-2 ~/
  ```
---

### 5. üìÅ Directory Creation with `mkdir`

* Basic usage
* Creating **parent directories** with `-p`
* Creating **multiple directories at once**


* **`mkdir <dirname>`** ‚Äì Creates a **single new directory** in the current path.
  Example:

  ```bash
  mkdir myfolder
  ```

* **`mkdir -p <parent/child>`** ‚Äì Creates **nested directories**, including any missing parent directories.
  Use this when intermediate folders may not exist.
  Example:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p projects/2025/june
  ```

  This creates the entire path: `projects/`, `2025/`, and `june/`.

* **Create multiple directories at once:**

  ```bash
  mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3
  ```

  This will create `folder1`, `folder2`, and `folder3` in the current directory in one command.

* **Using brace expansion to create structured sets of directories:**

  ```bash
  mkdir project_{A,B,C}
  ```

  This creates: `project_A`, `project_B`, and `project_C`.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p client_{X,Y,Z}/docs
  ```

  This creates three directories: `client_X/docs`, `client_Y/docs`, and `client_Z/docs` with nested `docs` folders.

  * **Create Directories `project_1` to `project_100` with a `docs` Subdirectory:**

  ```bash
  mkdir -p project_{1..100}/docs
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  * `project_{1..100}` creates `project_1`, `project_2`, ..., `project_100`.
  * The `/docs` adds a `docs` folder inside each.

  ---

  * **Create Directories `project_a` to `project_z` with a `docs` Subdirectory**

  ```bash
  mkdir -p project_{a..z}/docs
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  * `project_{a..z}` expands from `project_a` to `project_z`.
  * Each will contain its own `docs` folder.

  ---


### 6. üìÇ Directory Navigation with `cd`

* **`cd <dirname>`** ‚Äì Changes into the specified subdirectory.
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd projects
  ```

* **`cd /data/abc/test`** ‚Äì Navigates to the specified **absolute path** from root.
  Useful for jumping directly to a known full path.

* **`cd ..`** ‚Äì Moves **up one directory level** (to the parent directory).
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

* **`cd ../..`** ‚Äì Moves **up two levels** from the current directory.
  Handy when you need to quickly backtrack through the folder hierarchy.

* **`cd`** ‚Äì Changes to the **home directory** (`~`).
  Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

* **`cd -`** ‚Äì Switches back to the **previous working directory**.
  This is useful when toggling between two locations.

##  7. üîó Hard Links & Soft Links in Linux

---

### üìÅ What is a Link in Linux?

In Linux, a **link** allows multiple references (names) to point to the same data on disk. There are two primary types:

1. **Hard Link** ‚Äì Directly links to the file‚Äôs **inode**.
2. **Soft Link (Symbolic Link)** ‚Äì Links to the file‚Äôs **path** (acts like a shortcut).

---

## üîí Hard Link

### üìò Definition

A **hard link** creates another **filename** that directly refers to the same inode (storage) as the original file.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics

| Feature                  | Hard Link                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Points to                | File **inode**              |
| File content shared      | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| If original is deleted   | ‚ùå File **still exists**     |
| Works across filesystems | ‚ùå No                        |
| Can link to directories  | ‚ùå No (typically restricted) |
| Inode number             | ‚úÖ Same                      |

### üîß How to Create

```bash
ln original.txt hardlink.txt
```

### üî¨ Example

```bash
echo "Hello Hard Link" > file1.txt
ln file1.txt file1_hard.txt
ls -li file1.txt file1_hard.txt
```

Both files will show the **same inode number**, confirming they're hard-linked.

### üí° Note

Changes made to either file are reflected in both ‚Äî since they reference the same underlying data.

---

## üß∑ Soft Link (Symbolic Link)

### üìò Definition

A **soft link** (or symbolic link) is a file that contains a **path** to another file or directory.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics

| Feature                  | Soft Link                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Points to                | File **path** (not inode) |
| File content shared      | ‚úÖ Yes (via reference)     |
| If original is deleted   | ‚ùå Link breaks (dangling)  |
| Works across filesystems | ‚úÖ Yes                     |
| Can link to directories  | ‚úÖ Yes                     |
| Inode number             | ‚ùå Different               |

### üîß How to Create

```bash
ln -s /path/to/original.txt symlink.txt
```

Use **absolute paths** to avoid broken links from directory changes.

### üî¨ Example

```bash
echo "Hello Soft Link" > original.txt
ln -s original.txt softlink.txt
cat softlink.txt
```

Then delete the original:

```bash
rm original.txt
cat softlink.txt
```

You‚Äôll see:

```
cat: softlink.txt: No such file or directory
```

Because the **symlink is now dangling**.

---

## üß™ Inode Comparison

```bash
ls -li original.txt hardlink.txt softlink.txt
```

* `original.txt` and `hardlink.txt` ‚Üí Same **inode**.
* `softlink.txt` ‚Üí Different inode, shows `-> original.txt`.

---

## üö´ Cross-Filesystem Limitation (Hard Links)

Hard links **cannot span across different filesystems**:

```bash
ln /mnt/drive1/file.txt /mnt/drive2/hardlink.txt
```

This returns:

```
ln: failed to create hard link: Invalid cross-device link
```

‚úÖ Instead, use a soft link:

```bash
ln -s /mnt/drive1/file.txt /mnt/drive2/symlink.txt
```

---

## üß≠ Summary: Hard Link vs Soft Link

| Feature                  | Hard Link         | Soft Link           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Type                     | Direct inode      | Path reference      |
| Cross-filesystem support | ‚ùå No              | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Target deletion effect   | ‚ùå Still works     | ‚úÖ Becomes broken    |
| Inode number             | Same as original  | Different           |
| Can link to directories  | ‚ùå No              | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Typical use              | Low-level backups | Shortcuts, symlinks |

## 8. üìÅ Directory Aliases in Linux

---

### üß≠ What is a Directory Alias?

A **directory alias** is a shortcut or alternate name for a frequently used command or path. It saves time by letting you type a short name instead of a long command or path.

Aliases are usually set in your **shell configuration file** (like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.).

---

### üîß How to Create a Directory Alias

To define an alias for navigating to a specific directory:

```bash
alias proj='cd /home/hajith/projects/myapp'
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
proj
```

‚Ä¶and you‚Äôll be instantly taken to that folder.

---

### üìù Making It Permanent

To keep the alias after a reboot or new terminal session:

1. Open your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file in your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the alias at the bottom:

```bash
alias docs='cd ~/Documents'
```

3. Save and exit (`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl + X`)

4. Apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Aliases

```bash
alias dtop='cd ~/Desktop'
alias work='cd ~/workspace'
alias demodir='cd ~/abc/text/demo'
```

Use these to quickly navigate without typing the full path every time.

---

### üìú View All Aliases

```bash
alias
```

This lists all currently defined aliases.

---

### ‚ùå Remove an Alias (temporary)

```bash
unalias work
```

To remove it permanently, delete the line from `.bashrc`.

---

### ‚úÖ Bonus: Alias for `ls` and Directory Listings

```bash
alias ll='ls -la'
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
```

---

## 9. üìà Running Scripts in Background and Monitoring with `nohup`

---

### üß™ Example Python Script (`data_processing.py`)

```python
import time

a = 0
b = 5
while True:
    a = a + b
    print(f"updated value a: {a}", flush=True)
    time.sleep(3)
```

> üìù **Note:** `flush=True` ensures output is written immediately to the log file.

---

### üöÄ Running the Script in Background

```bash
nohup python3 -u data_processing.py >> data_process.log &
```

* `nohup`: Prevents termination when terminal closes.
* `python3 -u`: Runs Python in unbuffered mode (prints appear immediately).
* `>> data_process.log`: Appends output to the log file.
* `&`: Runs the command in the background.

---

### üîé Monitoring the Process

#### View system activity:

```bash
top
```

> Use `top` to monitor CPU, memory, and active processes.

#### List all processes:

```bash
ps
ps -aux
```

#### Filter specific script:

```bash
ps -aux | grep data_processing.py
```

This shows the PID (Process ID) of your script for further action.

---

### üìÑ Monitoring the Log Output

#### View log file contents:

```bash
cat data_process.log
```

#### Live log stream (updates in real time):

```bash
tail -f data_process.log
```

#### View last 10 lines of the log:

```bash
tail -10 data_process.log
```

---

### üõë Stopping the Script

Find the PID using:

```bash
ps -aux | grep data_processing.py
```

Example output:

```
hajith   12345  0.0  ... python3 data_processing.py
```

Then stop the process:

```bash
kill 12345
```

Or force kill if it doesn't stop:

```bash
kill -9 12345
```

---

## 10. üåê Download & Disk Usage Commands

---

### üîΩ `wget` ‚Äì Download Files from the Internet

### üßπ Clear Cached Memory (Drop Cache)

#### üîπ Free up page cache, dentries, and inodes (‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution)

```bash
sudo sh -c "sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
```

‚úÖ What it does:

* `sync` writes all pending disk writes to storage (flushes disk buffers)
* `echo 3 > ...drop_caches` clears:

  * PageCache (`1`)
  * Dentries and inodes (`2`)
  * Setting `3` clears **all three types**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This doesn't affect running programs but may temporarily slow performance as caches are rebuilt.

# üîóSSH and SCP Connectivity and Usage

  ## Introduction

  SSH (Secure Shell) and SCP (Secure Copy) are essential tools used to securely access and transfer files between systems over a network.

  ---

  ## SSH - Secure Shell

  ### 1. Installing SSH on Ubuntu

  To use SSH, make sure `openssh-server` is installed:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install openssh-server
  ```

  ### 2. Checking the IP Address

  If `ifconfig` is not available:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install net-tools
  ifconfig
  ```

  Look for a line like:

  ```
  inet 172.27.101.131
  ```

  This is your machine's IP address.

  ### 3. Connecting via SSH

  From another system, connect using the IP address:

  ```bash
  ssh username@IP
  ```

  Or connect using the username and hostname:

  ```bash
  hostname
  # Output: your-hostname

  ssh username@hostname
  ```

  ### 4. First-Time SSH Prompt

  When connecting to a host for the first time, SSH will ask for confirmation:

  ```
  The authenticity of host '172.20.124.218 (172.20.124.218)' can't be established.
  ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:sDPJbiVzKQib20zUN+3HtLQ/ZtKfakQtSsJ5mawt/S4.
  This key is not known by any other names.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
  ```

  * This is a security feature to prevent connecting to a spoofed system.
  * Type `yes` to continue.
  * Then you'll be prompted for the password:

  ```
  *****
  ```

  ### 5. Add to Resume

  > "Configured and used SSH for secure remote access and file transfer between Linux systems."

  ---

  ## Windows SSH Clients

  For Windows users:

  * **PuTTY** ‚Äì SSH terminal client
  * **WinSCP** ‚Äì GUI tool for secure file transfer (SCP/SFTP)

  ---

  ## SCP - Secure Copy

  ### 1. Using SCP to Copy Files

  To copy a file securely from one machine to another:

  ```bash
  scp /home/username/Day-2/image/OIP.Kl3R1bXcD_yd6xpq9txudAHaEo\?r\=0\&rs\=1\&pid\=ImgDetMain\&cb\=idpwebpc2 \
  username@hostname:/home/username/scpcopy/imagecopy
  ```

  * Replace the source and destination paths as needed.
  * This command copies the file to the remote system under the specified path.

  ### 2. For Other Systems

  To copy to a friend's system:

  ```bash
  scp <file> ubuntu@user1:/home/ubuntu/destination_path
  ```

  * Replace `username@hostname` with the appropriate user and hostname or IP address.

  ---

  ## Summary

  * Use **SSH** to connect securely to remote systems.
  * Use **SCP** to transfer files securely over SSH.
  * Tools like **PuTTY** and **WinSCP** make this easy on Windows.
