  * `-r` → Reverse the sort order

### 🧹 Remove Commands to Know

* **`rm <filename>`** – Removes the specified file.

* **`rm *`** – Removes all the files in the current directory (fails if it includes directories).

* **`rm filename*`** – Removes all files starting with "filename".

* **`rm *filename`** – Removes all files ending with "filename".

* **`rm -r <dirname>`** – Recursively deletes the specified directory and all its contents (use with caution!).

* **`rmdir <dirname>`** – Removes an **empty directory** (fails if not empty).

* **`rmdir dirname*`** – Removes all **empty directories** that start with "dirname".

* **`rm -v filename*`** – Deletes matching files and **shows what’s being deleted** (verbose mode).

### 📄 Commands – View, Copy, Rename/Move

* **`cat <filename>`** – Displays the **contents of a file** directly in the terminal.
  Useful for quickly reading file data.

  **Examples using paths:**

  ```bash
  cat ~/Documents/notes.txt
  ```

  – Displays content from a file in the user's `Documents` folder.

  ```bash
  cat /var/log/syslog
  ```

  – Reads a system log file using an **absolute path**.

  ```bash
  cat ../report.txt
  ```

  – Displays a file from the **parent directory**.

* **`cp <oldfilename> <newfilename>`** – Copies a file from source to destination.
  Used when you want to **duplicate** a file in the same or different directory.

* **`mv <oldfilename> <newfilename>`** – Renames or moves a file from source to destination.
  Acts as a **rename** if both files are in the same directory, or a **move** otherwise.

* **Copying using `cat` command:**
  **`cat <oldfilename> >> <newfilename>`** – Appends the content of `oldfilename` to `newfilename`.
  Can also be used for **manual file merging**.

  **Example with paths:**

  ```bash
  cat ~/notes/part1.txt >> ~/notes/complete.txt
  ```

  – Appends the contents of `part1.txt` into `complete.txt` in the `~/notes/` directory.

### 📁 File Copy, Move, and Rename – With Paths (Including `~` Home Shortcut)

* **Using `~` to represent the user's home directory:**

  ```bash
  cp ~/Downloads/file.txt ~/Documents/
  ```

  This copies `file.txt` from the `Downloads` folder to the `Documents` folder inside your home directory.

* **Rename a file inside the home directory:**

  ```bash
  mv ~/notes/todo.txt ~/notes/done.txt
  ```

  This renames `todo.txt` to `done.txt` in the `notes` directory under home.

* **Move a file to another directory using `~`:**

  ```bash
  mv ~/Pictures/image.png ~/Desktop/
  ```

* **Copy a file from another directory into your home folder:**

  ```bash
  cp /var/log/syslog ~/log_backup.txt
  ```

* **Copy file from current dir to a subdirectory in home:**

  ```bash
  cp myfile.txt ~/Documents/
  ```

* **Copy using relative path with tilde:**

  ```bash
  cp ../report.txt ~/Reports/
  ```

* **Copy a full folder into home:**

  ```bash
  cp -r /opt/project ~/project_backup
  ```

* **Move multiple files (e.g., `.txt`) to a folder in home:**

  ```bash
  mv *.txt ~/TextFiles/
  ```

### 📁 Directory Creation with `mkdir`

* Basic usage
* Creating **parent directories** with `-p`
* Creating **multiple directories at once**


* **`mkdir <dirname>`** – Creates a **single new directory** in the current path.
  Example:

  ```bash
  mkdir myfolder
  ```

* **`mkdir -p <parent/child>`** – Creates **nested directories**, including any missing parent directories.
  Use this when intermediate folders may not exist.
  Example:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p projects/2025/june
  ```

  This creates the entire path: `projects/`, `2025/`, and `june/`.

* **Create multiple directories at once:**

  ```bash
  mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3
  ```

  This will create `folder1`, `folder2`, and `folder3` in the current directory in one command.

* **Using brace expansion to create structured sets of directories:**

  ```bash
  mkdir project_{A,B,C}
  ```

  This creates: `project_A`, `project_B`, and `project_C`.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p client_{X,Y,Z}/docs
  ```

  This creates three directories: `client_X/docs`, `client_Y/docs`, and `client_Z/docs` with nested `docs` folders.

### 📂 Directory Navigation with `cd`

* **`cd <dirname>`** – Changes into the specified subdirectory.
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd projects
  ```

* **`cd /data/abc/test`** – Navigates to the specified **absolute path** from root.
  Useful for jumping directly to a known full path.

* **`cd ..`** – Moves **up one directory level** (to the parent directory).
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

* **`cd ../..`** – Moves **up two levels** from the current directory.
  Handy when you need to quickly backtrack through the folder hierarchy.

* **`cd`** – Changes to the **home directory** (`~`).
  Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

* **`cd -`** – Switches back to the **previous working directory**.
  This is useful when toggling between two locations.
