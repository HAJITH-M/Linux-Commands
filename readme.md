  This copies `file.txt` from the `Downloads` folder to the `Documents` folder inside your home directory.

* **Rename a file inside the home directory:**

  ```bash
  mv ~/notes/todo.txt ~/notes/done.txt
  ```

  This renames `todo.txt` to `done.txt` in the `notes` directory under home.

* **Move a file to another directory using `~`:**

  ```bash
  mv ~/Pictures/image.png ~/Desktop/
  ```

* **Copy a file from another directory into your home folder:**

  ```bash
  cp /var/log/syslog ~/log_backup.txt

### üìÅ Directory Creation with `mkdir`

* Basic usage
* Creating **parent directories** with `-p`
* Creating **multiple directories at once**


* **`mkdir <dirname>`** ‚Äì Creates a **single new directory** in the current path.
  Example:

  ```bash
  mkdir myfolder
  ```

* **`mkdir -p <parent/child>`** ‚Äì Creates **nested directories**, including any missing parent directories.
  Use this when intermediate folders may not exist.
  Example:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p projects/2025/june
  ```

  This creates the entire path: `projects/`, `2025/`, and `june/`.

* **Create multiple directories at once:**

  ```bash
  mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3
  ```

  This will create `folder1`, `folder2`, and `folder3` in the current directory in one command.

* **Using brace expansion to create structured sets of directories:**

  ```bash
  mkdir project_{A,B,C}
  ```

  This creates: `project_A`, `project_B`, and `project_C`.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p client_{X,Y,Z}/docs
  ```

  This creates three directories: `client_X/docs`, `client_Y/docs`, and `client_Z/docs` with nested `docs` folders.

### üìÇ Directory Navigation with `cd`

* **`cd <dirname>`** ‚Äì Changes into the specified subdirectory.
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd projects
  ```

* **`cd /data/abc/test`** ‚Äì Navigates to the specified **absolute path** from root.
  Useful for jumping directly to a known full path.

* **`cd ..`** ‚Äì Moves **up one directory level** (to the parent directory).
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

* **`cd ../..`** ‚Äì Moves **up two levels** from the current directory.
  Handy when you need to quickly backtrack through the folder hierarchy.

* **`cd`** ‚Äì Changes to the **home directory** (`~`).
  Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

* **`cd -`** ‚Äì Switches back to the **previous working directory**.
  This is useful when toggling between two locations.
