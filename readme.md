## 🚀 Getting Started: Your First Commands

### Know Where You Are
```bash
pwd          # Print current directory
whoami       # Show current user
uname -a     # Display system information
clear        # Clean up your terminal
```

These four commands are your compass in the Linux world. Always start here when you're lost!

## 📁 File and Directory Essentials

### Creating and Managing Files
```bash
# Create files
touch myfile.txt              # Empty file
echo "Hello" > greeting.txt   # File with content

# Create directories
mkdir myfolder                # Single directory
mkdir -p project/src/utils    # Nested directories
mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3 # Multiple at once
```

### Navigation Made Easy
```bash
cd myfolder     # Enter directory
cd ..           # Go up one level
cd ../..        # Go up two levels
cd ~            # Go to home directory
cd -            # Return to previous directory
```

**Pro Tip**: Use `cd -` to quickly toggle between two directories!

## 🔍 Listing Files Like a Pro

The `ls` command is more powerful than you think:

```bash
ls              # Basic listing
ls -a           # Show hidden files
ls -l           # Detailed information
ls -la          # Combine both
ls -lstr        # Sort by time, show sizes
```

### Powerful Pattern Matching
```bash
ls *.txt        # All .txt files
ls project_*    # Files starting with 'project_'
ls *_backup     # Files ending with '_backup'
```

---

## 🗂️ File Operations: Copy, Move, Remove

### The Safe Way to Handle Files
```bash
# Copying
cp file1.txt file2.txt           # Copy file
cp -r folder1/ folder2/          # Copy directory recursively

# Moving/Renaming
mv oldname.txt newname.txt       # Rename
mv file.txt ~/Documents/         # Move to another directory

# Removing (Be Careful!)
rm file.txt                      # Delete file
rm -r folder/                    # Delete directory
rm -i *.txt                      # Interactive deletion
```

**⚠️ Warning**: There's no recycle bin in Linux! Always double-check before using `rm`.

## 📄 Reading and Viewing Files

```bash
cat file.txt              # Display entire file
head -10 file.txt         # First 10 lines
tail -10 file.txt         # Last 10 lines
tail -f logfile.txt       # Follow file changes (great for logs!)
```

## 🔗 Links: Hard vs Soft

Understanding links is crucial for advanced file management:

### Hard Links
```bash
ln original.txt hardlink.txt
```
- Points directly to file data (inode)
- File survives even if original is deleted
- Cannot cross filesystems

### Soft Links (Symbolic)
```bash
ln -s /path/to/original.txt symlink.txt
```
- Points to file path
- Breaks if original is deleted
- Can cross filesystems and link to directories

## 🎯 Pattern Matching with Grep

Grep is your search superhero:

```bash
# Basic search
grep "ERROR" logfile.txt         # Find lines with ERROR
grep -i "error" logfile.txt      # Case-insensitive search
grep -v "DEBUG" logfile.txt      # Exclude DEBUG lines

# Advanced patterns
grep "^ERROR" logfile.txt        # Lines starting with ERROR
grep -r "TODO" ~/projects/       # Recursive search in directories
```

### Real-world Example: Finding Running Processes
```bash
ps -aux | grep python            # Find Python processes
ps -aux | grep -v grep           # Exclude grep itself from results
```

---

## 🔄 Background Processes and Monitoring

### Running Scripts in Background
```bash
# Run a long-running script
nohup python3 -u my_script.py >> output.log &

# Monitor the process
ps -aux | grep my_script.py
top                              # Real-time process monitoring

# Follow the log output
tail -f output.log
```

### Process Management
```bash
# Find process ID
ps -aux | grep script_name

# Stop process
kill 12345                       # Replace 12345 with actual PID
kill -9 12345                    # Force kill if needed
```

## 🗜️ Compression and Archives

### ZIP Operations
```bash
# Create archives
zip backup.zip file1.txt file2.txt
zip -r project.zip project_folder/

# Extract
unzip backup.zip
```

### TAR Operations
```bash
# Create tar archive
tar -cvf archive.tar folder/

# Extract tar archive
tar -xvf archive.tar
```

---

## 📊 System Monitoring and Statistics

### Disk and Memory Usage
```bash
# Disk usage
df -h                            # Overall disk usage
du -sh folder/                   # Size of specific folder
du -h | sort -hr                 # Sort by size

# Memory usage
free -h                          # Human-readable memory info
free -m                          # Memory in MB
```

### File Statistics
```bash
wc file.txt                      # Lines, words, characters
wc -l file.txt                   # Just line count
wc -w file.txt                   # Just word count
```

## 🌐 Network Operations

### Downloading Files
```bash
wget https://example.com/file.pdf
curl -O https://example.com/data.json
```

### Remote Access (SSH/SCP)
```bash
# Connect to remote server
ssh username@server-ip

# Copy files securely
scp local_file.txt username@server:/remote/path/
scp username@server:/remote/file.txt ./local_path/
```

## ⚡ Pro Tips and Shortcuts

### Time-Saving Aliases
Add these to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias ll='ls -la'
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias h='history'
```

### Directory Shortcuts
```bash
# Use ~ for home directory
cp file.txt ~/Documents/
mv ~/Downloads/*.pdf ~/Documents/PDFs/

# Brace expansion magic
mkdir project_{frontend,backend,database}
mkdir -p client_{1..10}/docs
```

### Command History Navigation
```bash
history                          # Show command history
!n                              # Run command number n from history
!!                              # Repeat last command
!grep                           # Run last command starting with 'grep'
```

## 🛠️ Putting It All Together: Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Setting Up a Development Project
```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p myapp/{src,tests,docs,config}
cd myapp

# Initialize with some files
touch README.md src/main.py tests/test_main.py
echo "# My Awesome App" > README.md

# Check your work
tree .  # or ls -la if tree isn't installed
```

### Scenario 2: Log Analysis
```bash
# Find all error entries from today's logs
grep -i "error" /var/log/app.log | tail -20

# Count different types of log entries
grep -c "INFO" app.log
grep -c "ERROR" app.log
grep -c "WARNING" app.log

# Save errors to a separate file
grep "ERROR" app.log > errors_today.txt
```

### Scenario 3: System Cleanup
```bash
# Find large files
find . -size +100M -type f

# Clean up temporary files
rm -rf /tmp/*
rm -f *.tmp *.log~

# Check disk usage before and after
df -h
```
