### ðŸ“‚ Directory Navigation with `cd`

* **`cd <dirname>`** â€“ Changes into the specified subdirectory.
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd projects
  ```

* **`cd /data/abc/test`** â€“ Navigates to the specified **absolute path** from root.
  Useful for jumping directly to a known full path.

* **`cd ..`** â€“ Moves **up one directory level** (to the parent directory).
  Example:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

* **`cd ../..`** â€“ Moves **up two levels** from the current directory.
  Handy when you need to quickly backtrack through the folder hierarchy.

* **`cd`** â€“ Changes to the **home directory** (`~`).
  Equivalent to:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

* **`cd -`** â€“ Switches back to the **previous working directory**.
  This is useful when toggling between two locations.
